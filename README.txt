This is a phone -> mouse project for my school's senior year engineering class
the project involves attempting to use code on a cellphone that would read in
accelerometer data, connect to the user's computer, and act as a mouse for
that computer. Right now, this is just a proof of concept to have something
for our presentation in May, but if it works well enough we may continue to
refine it.

There are two folders, MouseBluetooth and MouseNonBluetooth which each have
their own code in them

MouseBluetooth - Code in Android Studio to connect the phone and the laptop
using bluetooth, and send accelerometer data. 

MouseNonBluetooth - Code in Android Studio to connect the phone and the laptop
using a usb connection and send accelerometer data.
